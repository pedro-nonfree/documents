## Meeting Notes

### Palo Alto Library

- Started playing with IPFS, how to use for public
- Envision introducing IPFS for tech beginners
- Publish content onto IPFS network and exhibit in library
- Open phone browser, QR code, object shows on browser
- One-time workshop, target audience being teens + above

### Toronto Mesh

- Connected to TPL Fort York through dcwalk, and other discussions with various branches
- TPL Innovation Hubs
  - We did a full 6-module facilitation at Fort York Library
    - https://tomesh.net/peer-to-peer-internet/
  - North York Central Library has a whole floor for this!
- Lessons learned, don't do consecutive 6-week, do modular
  - Similar experiences with programming courses in Palo Alto Library, people in and out
- Students had differing motivations starting out, we lost many students throughout so not enough info to do proper before-after comparison, most felt they advanced their skills in networking + Raspberry Pi + p2p web
- Facilitation at conferences:
  - Many people have heard of IPFS, but had their first experience interacting with IPFS
  - Nice conversations & tinkering
- Long distance links?
  - None in Toronto
  - cjdns over Internet
  - 2 km links with directional WiFi hardware (e.g. Ubiquiti, MikroTik, open-source LibreRouter) commons in Guifi and other traditional community networks
- See networks.land & Commotion for social activity resource
- Is there an online version of this course?
  - At the moment, you have to be physically there to do this course for now although there are talks about making it an online course
  - IPFS launching proto.school
- Maker programs the TPLs are trying to do:
  - How to teach people to not just follow step-by-step, but to tinker
  - Continuation of learning after class? Take something home? Balance budget constraints
- Other workshop modules concern different layers of networks (e.g. social, physical) and other tech (e.g. LoRa)
- Social purpose fit between Toronto Mesh & Palo Alto Library
- Discussed current state of collab with Florida Polytechnic group, probably 2019 Q1 to see local facilitation there

### Future Collaborations

- Palo Alto Library to look into existing resources and may be in touch
- Invite to Mesh Sync:
